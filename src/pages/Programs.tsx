About the program
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a long-running global program run by Google that pairs student contributors with established open-source organizations. Participants produce significant code contributions over a summer coding period under mentorship; the program emphasizes real-world engineering, maintainability, and community collaboration. GSoC is widely recognized by employers and the open-source community as an indicator of meaningful contribution and professional discipline.

Eligibility
- Typically open to students and recent graduates (age policies vary by year; check the official site).
- Comfortable with coding and version control (Git/GitHub/GitLab).
- Willingness to communicate in English and adhere to project timelines.
- Note: exact eligibility rules may vary; always verify the current year’s policy on the official site.

Selection process
1. Explore participating organizations and their project ideas on the official site.
2. Engage with the organization early — comment on issues, join their chat channels, and submit small contributions demonstrating your intent.
3. Draft a clear proposal that includes problem statement, milestones, deliverables, timeline (weekly), and evaluation criteria.
4. Organizations assess applicants by prior contributions, the proposal’s clarity and feasibility, and communication with mentors.
5. Selected students enter the coding phase where regular updates and mentor interactions are required.

Preparation roadmap (6 months)
- Month 1: Master Git fundamentals — branching, rebases vs merges, pull requests, and CI basics.
- Month 2: Identify 2–3 organizations that match your skills. Read issue trackers and existing code. Fix small docs/typo issues to get familiar.
- Month 3: Complete 3–5 small PRs (documentation, tests, tiny bug fixes). Join community calls and learn code ownership & contribution workflow.
- Month 4: Build a rough project plan and a prototype if possible. Share it with potential mentors and ask for feedback.
- Month 5: Finalize and polish your proposal; seek peer reviews; prepare a short timeline and set communication checkpoints.
- Month 6: Submit proposal; prepare environment and development checklist for the coding period.

Tips
- Quality > quantity: one clear, well-documented contribution beats many shallow ones.
- Communicate proactively: ask clarifying questions, give status updates, and be respectful to maintainers' time.
- Keep a public, annotated repo of your past contributions and learning notes.
- Structure your proposal with measurable milestones and fallback plans.
