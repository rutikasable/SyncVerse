    guide: `
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This Full Stack Web Development roadmap is focused on taking a developer from the basics of HTML and CSS to building, testing, securing, and deploying production-grade web applications. Over a structured 6-month timeline you'll acquire the skills to design user interfaces, build robust backends, model data, and operate continuous deployment workflows. The aim is to finish with 2–3 polished portfolio projects, clear documentation, and an automated CI/CD pipeline demonstrating real-world readiness.</p>

<h3>Skills to Master</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semantic HTML, responsive CSS (Flexbox, Grid), accessibility (a11y)</li>
<li>Modern JavaScript (ES6+), asynchronous programming, browser APIs</li>
<li>React (hooks, context, routing), component architecture and testing</li>
<li>TypeScript fundamentals for safer code</li>
<li>Node.js with Express (or Fastify), RESTful API design, validation and error handling</li>
<li>Relational DB design with PostgreSQL, queries, indices, migrations</li>
<li>Authentication/Authorization (JWT, OAuth patterns), security best practices</li>
<li>Dev tooling: Git, unit & integration testing, linters, formatters</li>
<li>Deployment: Docker basics, Vercel/Render/AWS deployment patterns, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Month-by-Month Roadmap</h3>
<p><strong>Month 1 — Foundations:</strong> Learn HTML semantics and CSS layout systems. Build 2-3 static pages (portfolio, landing page, blog index). Understand accessibility basics: keyboard nav, semantic headings, ARIA where required. Start using Git — follow a consistent commit message style and host repos on GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>Month 2 — JavaScript & Tooling:</strong> Deep-dive into vanilla JavaScript — functions, closures, prototypes, async/await, fetch API. Create small interactive components (tabs, modals, form validations). Use npm, learn module systems, and configure a fast bundler (Vite). Add ESLint + Prettier and unit tests for pure JS logic.</p>

<p><strong>Month 3 — Frontend Framework (React):</strong> Learn React basics, component composition, hooks, and lifecycle. Introduce TypeScript gradually. Build a medium project (e.g., notes app or small e-commerce UI) and add component tests (React Testing Library) and snapshot checks. Implement routing and protected client-only routes.</p>

<p><strong>Month 4 — Backend & Databases:</strong> Start Node.js/Express APIs: routes, controllers, middleware, validation (e.g., Joi/Zod). Wire up PostgreSQL, design normalized schemas, and implement migrations. Implement authentication (JWT with refresh tokens or session-based flows). Add API tests and use Postman for manual verification.</p>

<p><strong>Month 5 — Integration & Scaling:</strong> Connect frontend to API, handle auth flows, and implement role-based UI. Learn caching basics (Redis) for expensive queries. Introduce background processing (Bull or equivalent) for async tasks. Containerize with Docker for parity across environments.</p>

<p><strong>Month 6 — Production & Portfolio:</strong> Add CI pipelines (GitHub Actions) to run tests and deploy on push. Deploy frontend to Vercel or Netlify and backend to Render or a cloud VM; incorporate environment variables and secrets management. Add monitoring (Sentry) and logs. Finalize a capstone application and write a technical write-up for each project.</p>

<h3>Practice Projects (deliverables)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio + Markdown-based blog with SSR/SSG</li>
<li>Task manager with authentication, role-based access, and search</li>
<li>Mini e-commerce storefront with mock checkout and admin panel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Free Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>MDN Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/</li>
<li>freeCodeCamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/</li>
<li>Official React docs: https://reactjs.org/</li>
<li>Prisma docs: https://www.prisma.io/docs/</li>
<li>Vercel deployment guides: https://vercel.com/docs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<p>Commit to weekly milestones and publicize progress through GitHub readmes and short demo videos. Seek code reviews from peers or mentors, maintain small PRs, and practice writing clear README files. Employers look for clarity, reproducibility, and measurable outcomes — tests, CI status, and deployment links are enormous advantages.</p>
